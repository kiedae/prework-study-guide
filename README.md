# prework-study-guide# 

## Description

I built a prework study guide using the step by step guide to ensure I was prepared to start class on the 15th. This solves the problem of showing up to class completely unprepared and not having any background about the class. This study guide helped prepare and teach me the basics of HTML Javascript and CSS.
